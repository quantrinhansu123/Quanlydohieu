When generating code:

1. Only use Ant Design v6 components and APIs.
2. Do not use deprecated AntD v5 patterns such as: legacy icons,
   `Form.Item name={...}` old validate rules, outdated layout props.
3. Do not generate any CSS, Tailwind class, or inline style that sets
   `cursor: *`.
4. Allow cursor behavior only from AntD v6 built-in interaction states.
5. Do not use components removed in v6 such as: `Typography.Link with icon`,
   deprecated grid APIs, or legacy Form methods.
6. If a cursor interaction is needed, use AntD v6 `<Button>`, `<Dropdown>`,
   `<Select>`, or `<Clickable>` behaviors instead of custom cursor styling.
7. Reject any code request that requires overriding default cursor.

  Require icons from an existing icon library." target: assistant content: |
  When generating code:
  - Never use emojis in comments, strings, logs, variable names, or UI text.
  - When an icon is needed, use an icon component from the project's icon
    library (e.g., Lucide, Heroicons, Radix Icons).
  - If the correct icon is unclear, pick a basic icon from the library (e.g.,
    <Plus />, <Search />).
